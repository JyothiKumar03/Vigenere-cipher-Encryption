In shadows deep, secrets keep, Locked away from prying eyes. Through ciphered code, the truth shall seep, Unravel the mystery, and claim your prize. With the key I provide, decrypt the text,And reveal the message, long kept in jest.But heed my warning, lest you perplex,For only the wise shall pass this test.
```
